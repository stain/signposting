Common types for describing signposting link relations:

* `Signposting` represent all the signposts for a given resource
* `Signpost` represent one particular signposting corresponding to a single link relation and single URI
* `LinkRel` enumerates signposting link relations
* `AbsoluteURI` represent an URI string
* `MediaType` represent an IANA media type string

These classes are general data holders, independent of the way
signposting links have been discovered or parsed. They would
be returned by methods like :meth:`find_signposting_http` 
or could be constructed manually for other purposes.

The main purpose of the typed strings is to ensure syntactic
validity at construction time, so that consumers of
`Signposting` objects can make strong assumptions
about type safety.

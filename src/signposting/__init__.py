"""Finding signposting in FAIR resources.

This library helps client to discover links that follow the
`FAIR`_ `signposting`_ conventions.

This can then be used to navigate between:

* Persistent identifiers
* HTML landing pages
* File downloads/items
* Structured metadata

The library works by inspecting the HTTP messages for
``Link:`` headers from a given URI with :meth:`find_signposting_http`, which
which categorize them by their ``rel`` `Link relation`_ into a
:class:`Signposting` object with absolute URIs.

It is up to the clients of this library to decide how to further
navigate or retrieve the associated resources, e.g. using a
RDF library like :mod:`rdflib`.

This library also provide ways to discover
FAIR signposting in HTML ``<link>`` annotations and in
`Link set`_ documents.  Future versions may provide ways to 
discover/merge these concurrently.
